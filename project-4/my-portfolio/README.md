# My Portfolio

## Project Overview

Creating a personal website to showcase my projects ðŸ’«

## Motivation

Primarily, it is driven by the desire to have all my existing projects in one place. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Tech/frameworks Used

Built with 

* Nextjs
* Tailwindcss

### Features

A very simple design featuring a bit about me, what I can offer and a few links to my collateral. 

### Approach Taken

I started off by writing out the content that I intended on including on the website. I then quickly sketched what it would look like on Figma and proceeded to code the real thing bit by bit, seperating each major part into sections. 

### Difficulties encountered when building this

I have never really enjoyed css, so tailwind really helped simply design. I felt the logic behind 'dark mode' would be complex to understand conceptually, but I found that tailwind simplified that completely for me. 

### Credits & Acknowledgements 
A special thanks to Joel, CJ, Mark & Tina for helping me put this together.
